# Order Notification Manager

# Overview

This plugin will enable the user to manage order notifications in POS.

## Working principles

An icon will be added to the navigation bar. When any unpicked orders exist, then
the icon will turn red. After clicking on the icon the uncompleted orders view
will be opened.
